## How to Run

These scripts use `prompt()` and `console.log()`, so they are intended to be run in a browser environment. Here's how to do that:

1. Open the script file in a text editor.
2. Copy the code and paste it into your browser's Developer Console (press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`, then go to the **Console** tab).
3. Press **Enter** to run.
